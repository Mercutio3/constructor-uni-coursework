a) The line "using namespace std;" tells the compiler to look for the
input and output functions in the standard (std) library. The error
message will state that functions like "cout", "cin", and "endl" are not
defined. If you wanted to fix this without adding the namespace, you
would have to explicitly add "std::" before each usage of the function.
This works identically but can be very impractical for longer programs.

b) Removing the "Critter::" prefix from, for example, the "setName"
method returns an error for an "undeclared identifier". Because the 
variable "name" and the "setName" method itself are declared and 
defined in the "Critter.h" header file, you need to specifically
indicate the compiler to use variable and methods from the imported
library. A potential alternative solution would be to define a "Critter"
namespace.
